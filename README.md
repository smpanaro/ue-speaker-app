#  ue-roll-control

iOS app for the UE Roll bluetooth speaker that adds Siri Shortcuts support so you can turn your speaker on and off hands-free.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️
There's a real chance you destroy your speaker. Continue at your own risk.

## Features
- Turn the speaker on/off from the app (same as the official app)
- Turn the speaker on/off via a Siri Shortcut (e.g. "Hey Siri", or the Shortcuts iOS app)

## Prior Work
This project builds on the work of a few other people. Specifically:

- marcust's [gist](https://gist.github.com/marcust/af93ff47899583f5a52f) to power on a speaker
- mlalkaka's [gist](https://gist.github.com/mlalkaka/bc066e55d59e445a310fa37b9a6a661c) to power off a speaker
- u/notkitharington's [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bluetooth/comments/ap6npx/bluetooth_protocol_for_ue_boom_2/) for the idea to decompile the Android APK
